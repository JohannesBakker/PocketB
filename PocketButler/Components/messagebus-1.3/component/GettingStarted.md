MessageBus is a cross platform EventBus system similar to NSNoticationCenter on iOS and otto on Android that allows you to decouple your code whilst still allowing your applications components to communicate with each other.  MesssageBus can be used instead of events and can be used to communicate between objects that are not directly linked.

## Usage

`MessageBus.Default` provides a central Multi-thread singleton for you to subscribe to and post events.  You can use this or have multiple separate `MessageBus` objects of your own.


	using DSoft.Messaging;
	...
	
	var newBus = new MessageBus();
	 
**Registering Event Handlers**

To subscribe to an event you can create a `MessageBusEventHandler` object and then register it with the MessageBus.  The event handler allows you to set the Id of the event to subscribe to and an Action or Delegate to call be when the event occurs.

	using DSoft.Messaging;
	...
	
	var newEvHandler = new MessageBusEventHandler()
	{
		EventId = "1234",
		Action = (sender, evnt) =>
		{
			//Code goes here
		},
	};
	
	MessageBus.Default.Register(newEvHandler);

You can then deregister an event handler or simply clear all handlers for a specific EventId


	using DSoft.Messaging;
	...

	//deregister
	MessageBus.Default.DeRegister(newEvHandler);
	
	//Clear all event handlers
	MessageBus.Default.Clear("1234");

*Note: You must execute any code that updates the UI, contained within your event action or delegate, on the UI thread*

**Posting Events**

You can then post an event from anywhere in your application using the Id of the event to execute the Action in the registered `MessageBusEventHandler` objects.

To post an event you create an instance of `CoreMessageBusEvent`, set the EventId, sender and any additional data you want to send and then call Post on the relevant MessageBus.
 
	using DSoft.Messaging;
	...
	
	var newEvent = new CoreMessageBusEvent()
	{
		EventId = "1234",
		Sender = this,
		Data = new object[]{"This is a message"},
	};
	
	MessageBus.Default.Post(newEvent);

You can also post an event with just the EventId, with the EventId and the sender or EventId, Sender and data, without creating a CoreMessageBusEvent object

	using DSoft.Messaging;
	...
	
	MessageBus.Default.Post("1234");
	MessageBus.Default.Post("1234",this);
	MessageBus.Default.Post("1234",this, new object[]{"This is a message"});
	
If you are only using the default MessageBus you can post using the class methods instead.

	using DSoft.Messaging;
	...
	
	var newEvent = new CoreMessageBusEvent()
	{
		EventId = "1234",
		Sender = this,
		Data = new object[]{"This is a message"},
	};
	
	MessageBus.PostEvent(newEvent);
	MessageBus.PostEvent("1234");
	MessageBus.PostEvent("1234",this);
	MessageBus.PostEvent("1234",this, new object[]{"This is a message"});

**UI Thread**  
You must execute any code that updates the UI, contained within your event action or delegate, on the UI thread*

This is an example on iOS withing a `UIView` but other platforms have a similar concept.

	using DSoft.Messaging;
	...
	
	var newEvHandler = new MessageBusEventHandler()
	{
		EventId = "1234",
		Action = (sender, evnt) =>
		{
			//Code goes here
			BeginInvokeOnMainThread (() => {
				//post to the output box
				txtOutput.Text += data2 + Environment.NewLine;
			});
		},
	};
	
**Custom Events**	

You can sub-class `MessageBusEvent` to allow you to pass additional information in the event, without having to pass it in the Data property.  

You can then register for events based on the type of the event, rather than the event Id.


	using DSoft.Messaging;
	...
	
	MessageBus.Default.Register<CustomMessageBusEvent> (CustomMessageEventHandler);

	MessageBus.Default.Register<CustomMessageBusEvent> ((sendr, evnt) => {
    
      	//code goes here
	});

You can also deregister based on type

	MessageBus.Default.DeRegister<CustomMessageBusEvent> (CustomMessageEventHandler);

**Excuting code on the UI Thread**

When MessageBus executes your action code it will not do it on the main UI Thread.  This is to avoid blocking of the UI for long running actions or where there are lots of handlers for an event.

You may wish to update you UI in the action code assigned to the Event Handler and you can do this two ways depending on where your event handler exists.

 - If your event handler is in "Platform" specific code you can use the current context to execute the code E.g. BeginInvokeOnMainThread(iOS), Actvity.RunOnUIThread(Android), Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(Windows Phone)
 - If your handler is in the PCL space you can use Task.Factory.StartNew and pass the current Syncronization context.  
  
An example of the second approach is below.

	using DSoft.Messaging;
	...
	
	var newEvHandler = new MessageBusEventHandler()
	{
		EventId = "1234",
		Action = (sender, data) =>
		{
			//Code goes here
			for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
	        {
	            Console.WriteLine(i);
	        }
	        
	        //update the UI
	        Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
            {
                this.label1.Text = "Task past first work section...";
            }, CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.None, TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext());
		},
	};
	
	MessageBus.Default.Register(newEvHandler);
