    <strong>PLACING AN ORDER</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    4.1 Prior to placing an order with the PB App, you will be required to enter personal information about yourself and register payment details which will be
    saved under your PB App account (<strong>Profile</strong>). Once you have created your Profile, you can begin to place Orders with the Venues of your
    choosing.
</p>
<p>
    4.2 When you place an Order using the PB App, this constitutes an offer by you to PocketButler to purchase the Goods. PocketButler is free to accept or
    reject your Order.
</p>
<p>
    4.3 If PocketButler accepts your Order then your purchase of the Goods is subject to these Terms of Use. The PB App will notify you by accepting your order
    and providing you with an order confirmation containing a unique code (<strong>Code</strong>) to let you know that your Order has been accepted and that
    the Goods that you have purchased are being prepared. It is at this point that the Contract is formed and your Payment Card will be debited in the amount
    of the Order. The PB App will notify you by sending you an in-app notification to let you know when the Goods that you have purchased are ready for you to
    collect (<strong>Collection Alert</strong>) and you must then show the Code to collect the Goods that you have purchased from the dedicated collection area
    at the Venue or otherwise present the Code when the Goods are delivered (as determined by the Venue). A receipt for the Goods that you have purchased will
    appear in the 'My Orders' section of your Profile.

    the tab is closed out the following day. Unused pre-authorised amounts will be held by your bank until the banks holding period expires.
</p>
<p>
    4.5 If PocketButler rejects your Order then you will be notified via an in-app message and your Payment Card will not be charged.
</p>
<p>
    4.6 Acceptance of your Order (or placing an Order) does not entitle you to receive any other goods, services, rights or privileges, including but not
    limited to entry to a Venue on either a guaranteed, free or queue jumping basis, or reserved seating.
</p>
<p>
    4.7 You will be charged the Fee for purchasing Goods via the PB App.
</p>
<p>
    4.8 In the event that you are unable to collect the Goods that you have purchased because you are delayed or prevented from entering the Venue, then unless
    either PocketButler or the Venue was solely responsible for you being either delayed or prevented from entering the Venue, then neither PocketButler nor
    the Venue shall be liable and you accept and agree that no refund shall be provided to you.
</p>
<p>
    4.9 PocketButler may terminate the Contract (for example by instructing the Venue to refuse to allow you to collect the Goods that you have purchased) in
    the event that:
</p>
<p>
    (a) in its sole discretion it considers that you do not meet any of the criteria set out in clause 2.3 (a) to (c) above;
</p>
<p>
    (b) in its sole discretion it considers that fulfilling the Order would be a breach of Applicable Law;
</p>
<p>
    (c) you are unable to provide the Code when collecting the Goods that you have purchased; or
</p>
<p>
    (d) you fail to collect the Goods that you have purchased within <em>15 minutes</em> of receiving the Collection Alert,
</p>
<p>
    and in such circumstances, you accept and agree that no refund shall be available, save in relation to (c) and (d) where if either PocketButler or the
    Venue was solely responsible for you being unable to provide the Code or collect the Goods that you had purchased, you will receive a refund by way of a
    credit to your Payment Card in the amount of the Order.
</p>
<p>
    4.10 You acknowledge and agree that the Venue is solely responsible for:
</p>
<p>
    (a) the supply of any Goods to you; and
</p>
<p>
    (b) ensuring that any Goods offered for sale and supply via the PB App are available for sale and supply or, if any of them are not, notifying you and
    other customers that such Goods are not available.
</p>
<p>
    4.11 In the event that you do not receive your Order within 30 minutes], you must contact the Venue to arrange the supply of the Order or a refund, to be
    determined by the Venue at its sole discretion. You hereby release and forever discharge us from any liability we might have in respect of a failure by the
    Venue to supply the Order.
